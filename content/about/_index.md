I’m Christina. I’m currently a digital library architect (acting). I have been and still consider myself a GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) dataist, or I work with GLAM data in about any way that can be defined. I’m interested in developing better and more flexible architectures, data tools and workflows that can better integrate and expose information across domains and applications. I have done a fair amount of work in metadata quality analysis/control work and the expanding idea and accessibility to metadataists of library data sources.

Previously, I’ve tried to define <code>data operations</code> in the context of library technology. Currently, I’m trying to proposed multiple architectures for various GLAM sub-domains that can all interact via shared data infrastructure.

I also really like urban biking, beer, coffee, sopes, burritos, biscuits and tamarindo.
